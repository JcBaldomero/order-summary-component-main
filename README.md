### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I learned that you need to add a height to the parent div in order to apply align-items(flex) into its child contents.



```html

<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">.</div>  
</div>
```
```css
.parent{
  width:300px;
  height:400px;
  display:flex;
  align-items:center;
}
```
